// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    // This test requires dependency injection to be set up
    // For now, we'll skip it until we set up proper test configuration
    // TODO: Set up proper test environment with mocked dependencies
  });
